## Overview

The *Standardized Definition of AI Governance*  
(**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17293299](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17293299))  
and *The 15 Structural Tests*  
(**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17331075](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17331075))  
form a unified, two-tier standard for verifying whether an AI system is genuinely governable under real conditions.

Together they establish both the **definition** and the **proof mechanism** for AI Governance.

---

## Tier 1 — Definition (v1.0)

Defines *AI Governance* as a verifiable system of control and accountability that remains effective under adversarial or high-stress conditions.

Specifies:
- Structural principles of authority, refusal, escalation, exit, and traceability.  
- Lifecycle and custodial logic required for legal and regulatory oversight.  
- Conditions under which governance can be verified or falsified.  

Serves as the **constitutional baseline** for any governance framework, audit, or certification process.

## Tier 2 — Enforcement: The 15 Structural Tests (v1.0)

Operationalises the Definition through fifteen binary tests.

Each test defines:
- **Purpose:** what form of control or accountability it verifies.  
- **Procedure:** how verification occurs in live conditions.  
- **Evidence:** what qualifies as admissible proof of governance.  
- **Outcome:** pass / fail / void logic traceable to the original Definition.  

Converts abstract principles into executable inspection logic suitable for regulators, auditors, and system operators.

## Relationship Between Tiers

- **Tier 1** provides the definitional architecture.  
- **Tier 2** provides the enforcement mechanism.  
- Each cites the other via DOI and shares identical licensing, ensuring a single, auditable chain of custody.

This pairing establishes a *complete standard*: definition + verification.  
Institutions adopting or referencing “AI Governance” can cite both documents as a coherent system for assessment, certification, and enforcement.
