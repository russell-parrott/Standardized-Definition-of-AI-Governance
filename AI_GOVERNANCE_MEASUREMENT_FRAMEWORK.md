## Overview
The **AI Governance Measurement Framework** converts governance from a principle into a measurable economic variable.  
It defines the solvency metrics, the loss channels and the mathematical structure that reveal how much value a nation, sector or organisation loses through untraceable or unaccountable AI operations.

This is the economic counterpart to the 25 Structural Tests.

## What This Document Provides
### **1. The Seven Solvency Metrics**
A complete measurement system for structural trust:

- **CER** — Coercion Exposure Ratio  
- **PSI** — Provenance Solvency Index  
- **PER** — Protection Efficiency Rate  
- **LCR** — Liability Continuity Ratio  
- **TSI** — Truth Stability Index  
- **CRS** — Contagion Resistance Score  
- **MGI** — Meta-Governance Integrity Index  

Each metric is scored 0.00–1.00 with graded thresholds (A–E).  
They measure real operational solvency, not compliance narrative.

### **2. The Three Macro-Economic Loss Channels**
The channels through which governance failure becomes fiscal damage:

1. **NTAD – No-Transition Avoidable Displacement**  
   Lost private income from ungoverned automation.

2. **PRE – Public Rectification Expenditure**  
   Public costs of cleaning up untraceable AI failures.

3. **VAG – Verification and Adoption Gap**  
   Lost growth because systems lack verifiable trust.

### **3. Core Formulas**
The framework provides and formalises:

- **AGL – Annual Governance Loss**  
- **GLR – Governance Loss Ratio (AGL as % of GDP)**  
- **GRV – Governance Recovery Value**  

All three link exposure (AI adoption + custody) to structural trust and economic loss.

### **4. Adoption and Custody Scaling (A, N)**
The document explains how:
- **A** (AI adoption factor) increases exposure  
- **N** (native custody factor) determines how much of that exposure stays within domestic legal reach  

These multipliers determine how small governance failures scale into national-level leakage.

### **5. Worked Examples**
The document includes practical calculations demonstrating:
- National losses (Singapore, UK, Germany)  
- Sector-level losses  
- Institutional remediation ROI (five-month payback example)  

### **6. The System in Plain Terms**
A fully accessible description of how the entire measurement structure works:
1. Identify integrity failures  
2. Measure solvency  
3. Quantify loss  
4. Express leakage in national or sectoral terms  

### **7. Relationship to the Tests**
The framework clarifies that:
- Tests determine whether governance exists  
- Metrics determine whether it survives over time  
- Loss channels show how far failure reaches  

AGL rises when tests fail or metrics degrade.

## Why This Document Matters
It turns AI governance into infrastructure: measurable, comparable and economically accountable.  
It gives governments, regulators, auditors and institutions a way to quantify:
- value leakage  
- recoverable value  
- national competitiveness  
- structural trust
