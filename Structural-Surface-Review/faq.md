# FAQ

## Is this consulting?
No.  
The process does not analyse your internal systems, design governance controls or recommend remediation.  
It applies a fixed diagnostic template to public evidence only.

## What information do you need?
Only public URLs or documents.  
If it isn’t public, it cannot appear in the report.

## Can the review be influenced?
No.  
The rules forbid interpretation, assumption, invention, or advisory framing.
Evidence must come directly from retrieved public sources.

## What is the turnaround time?
**24–72 hours**, depending on the size of the system’s public footprint.

## How long is the report?
Typically **15–30 pages**, depending on how much public evidence exists.

## What does a “Fail” mean?
A structural condition is missing or contradicted in public materials.  
It does *not* mean wrongdoing — only that the system's published posture is structurally weak under the test.

## Can this be used for due diligence?
Yes - with the caveat that it covers public posture only, not internal operations or controls.

## Is the template customisable?
No.  
The fixed design ensures neutrality, reproducibility and non-entanglement.

## Why can this be hosted on GitHub?
Because the process is structural, rule-bound and transparent.  
The site extends the standards repository; it does not create a service footprint.
