# Pricing & Turnaround

A Structural Surface Review is not consultancy and not commentary. It is an external, doctrine-driven diagnostic that applies the same structural logic a regulator would use when testing a system for accountability, integrity and enforceability. Nothing in the process bends to narrative, branding or intention only to public evidence. What you receive is a result that stands on its own: independent, reproducible and defensible, because it is produced under non-negotiable rules rather than client direction.

## Fixed Fee

**€3450 per system**  (one domain, one public documentation set)

- No tiers.

## Turnaround Time
