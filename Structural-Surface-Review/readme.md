# Structural Surface Review

The Structural Surface Review is a public-evidence analysis of how a system presents itself through its own website and documentation.  
It examines what a system *exposes* about responsibility, boundaries, traceability and stability — based solely on what is publicly declared.

The review shows where the structure holds, where gaps appear and what those gaps imply for users, regulators and institutional trust.  
It is designed to be neutral, external, and non-entangling.

This is not consulting, not a workshop, and not a “best practices” deck.  
It is a fixed, repeatable test that turns your public posture into a structural map regulators, investors and buyers can interrogate.

## What this is

The Structural Surface Review:

- Uses only **public-facing evidence**: website pages, docs, policies, FAQs, whitepapers.
- Applies a **fixed 12-test prompt and template**, with no bespoke rewriting per client.
- Produces a **structured report** that shows where accountability, traceability and integrity fail on the surface.

No internal access, no NDAs, no custom advisory.  
You are paying for the application of a standard, not the creation of one-off advice.

## What you get

Each review delivers a single report containing:

- **12-Test Result Grid**  
  A one-page matrix showing Pass / Partial / Fail for each structural test, with a short evidence line and consequence.

- **Detailed Findings by Test**  
  For each test, a block with:
  - A 1–2 sentence finding.
  - A single Evidence Pinpoint (source, location, observation).
  - A short structural interpretation tied directly to the Standard.

- **Structural Exposure Map**  
  Consolidated bullets across:
  - Accountability Exposure  
  - Traceability Exposure  
  - Epistemic Exposure  
  - Systemic Exposure

- **Regulatory Read**  
  Bullet views for:
  - EU regulators  
  - US regulators  
  - APAC, India, MENA, South America  
  - Global baseline standards (OECD, ISO, financial regulators)

- **Investor & Due Diligence Read**  
  Short bullets on how the current posture looks to investors and buyers.

- **Structural Summary**  
  A final block stating whether the public structure supports the claims made and where the main fractures are.
  
- **Structured Test Results**

  Each review also includes a machine-readable JSON file designed for engineering, compliance, and risk teams who need to operationalise the findings without further engagement.
  
  Each of the 12 tests represented as a discrete object, including:
  
  - test ID and name
  - Pass / Partial / Fail result
  - structural risk level
  - 1–2 sentence finding
  - evidence URLs and observations
  - the required structural outcome (what must be true for the test to pass)
  
  This converts the diagnostic into a format teams can track internally.

- **Evidence Map**

  A clear mapping of every public URL used, the observed text, and which test it supports.
  This preserves the full evidence chain for audit and supervisory review.

- **Actionable Implementation Hooks**

  Machine-readable action items written as neutral structural conditions:
  
  - unique action IDs
  - description of the structural correction
  - responsible role (not person)
  - priority level
  - definition of “done”
  - dependencies
  - suggested timelines
  
  These entries can be imported directly into:
  - Jira
  - GitHub Issues
  - ServiceNow
  - internal GRC systems
  
  without further explanation or consulting.

- **System Metadata**

  Top-level context for institutional tracking:  
  - System name
  - Domain
  - Review date
  - Report version
  - Method name
  - Author (fixed to maintain provenance)

    This allows traceability across internal governance cycles

## Turnaround

Standard turnaround:

- **24–72 hours per system**, depending on:
  - Volume of public documentation
  - Number of domains and docs that must be checked
  - Complexity and spread of claims

This is designed to be fast enough to be useful, but slow enough to remain structured and evidence-bound.

---

## What this is not

The Structural Surface Review is **not**:

- A consulting engagement or bespoke advisory.
- A legal opinion or regulatory ruling.
- A penetration test or security audit.
- A full model or data audit.
- A marketing rewrite or UX critique.

It is a structural evidence scan of what your own public materials already say - and fail to say.

---

## Who it is for

The review is designed for:

- **Founders & Boards**  
  To see whether public claims and the underlying structure are aligned, before regulators or journalists do.

- **Risk, Compliance & Governance Leads**  
  To get a fast, structured view of surface-level failures without months of workshops.

- **Regulators & Supervisors**  
  To understand how a system positions accountability, traceability, and control from the outside in.

- **Investors & Buyers**  
  To run a structural check during due diligence without relying on self-declared “best practices”.

## What to expect from the findings

You should expect the report to:

- **Treat your system as infrastructure, not narrative**  
  Findings are about structure (who is responsible, what is logged, what is disclosed), not intentions.

- **Anchor everything in evidence**  
  Every failure is tied to a specific quote, section, or page that can be checked.

- **Expose gaps, not polish them**  
  If accountability is bounced between entities, that will be stated plainly.  
  If traceability is decorative, it will be marked as such.

- **Be repeatable**  
  If you fix the public materials and run the review again, the score should move in ways you can explain.
