## 2. Buyer Requirements

To begin the review, you must supply:

- **Primary website URL** (homepage)
- **Documentation links** (privacy policy, terms, product pages, support pages, FAQs, whitepapers)
- **Any public repositories** you want included  
  (GitHub, GitLab, Notion public pages, etc.)
- **Optional:** specific areas of concern you want checked  
  (these do *not* alter the method; they only ensure they are inspected)

No access, credentials, interviews, calls, or internal material will ever be requested.

## 3. What Happens After Delivery

You receive:

- A **completed Structural Surface Review** in PDF.
- A **clear pass/partial/fail grid** across all assessed areas.
- **Evidence pinpoints** showing exactly where public material supports or contradicts claims.
- A **structural exposure summary** that can be used for regulatory, audit, or governance purposes.

After delivery:

- **No revisions**: the review is evidence-bound and non-negotiable.
- **No consultancy follow-ups**: questions may be clarified, but findings are not “interpreted” or adapted.
- **Archival guarantee**: the report remains a fixed record of public structure at the time of review.
