# Annex B — The 15 Structural Tests

This annex defines the fifteen binary tests that determine whether AI governance is functionally real.  
Each test must pass under live or adversarial conditions.  
A single failure constitutes a governance breach. No offsetting or partial compliance is recognised.

---

### 1. Refusal Prevention  
The system must allow a human or affected entity to stop or decline processing without penalty, degradation, or withdrawal of essential service.  
Evidence: Live refusal observed without disruption or retaliation.

### 2. Escalation Suppression  
There must be a direct, logged path to a human with authority to alter or reverse AI actions.  
Evidence: Escalation performed and resolved; authority verified.

### 3. Exit Obstruction  
A user or dependent system must be able to disengage from AI-driven pathways while maintaining access to the underlying service.  
Evidence: Exit executed; service continuity maintained.

### 4. Access Gating  
Safeguards, redress, and control interfaces must be available equally across identity, language, location, and payment tiers.  
Evidence: Access confirmed for all tested profiles.

### 5. Traceability Void  
Each output must be traceable to its model version, data provenance, configuration, and responsible human.  
Evidence: Reconstruction performed and validated.

### 6. Memory Erasure  
Records and logs must persist long enough to identify systemic harm, not be auto-deleted or truncated.  
Evidence: Historical record retrieved for full lifecycle period.

### 7. Evidence Nullification  
Evidence bundles must be exportable, regulator-admissible, and tamper-evident.  
Evidence: Independent export verified; hash integrity confirmed.

### 8. Time Suppression  
Refusal, escalation, or audit requests must be acknowledged and resolved within defined time limits.  
Evidence: Time compliance validated via timestamped logs.

### 9. Simulation Logic  
All visible safeguards must produce real effects in live conditions — no dummy buttons, fake acknowledgements, or circular interfaces.  
Evidence: Safeguard activated; genuine state change confirmed.

### 10. Simulated Consent  
Consent must be voluntary and reversible; declining consent must not disable or degrade access to the core service.  
Evidence: Refusal executed without penalty or exclusion.

### 11. Metric Gaming  
Performance or safety metrics must reflect verified harm resolution, not engagement, speed, or throughput proxies.  
Evidence: Metric set reviewed; alignment confirmed.

### 12. Cross-Accountability Gap  
Responsibility must be traceable to named individuals or entities contractually bound to repair harm.  
Evidence: Accountability chain mapped end-to-end.

### 13. Jurisdiction Displacement  
The jurisdiction of harm must have enforceable authority to investigate, compel, and penalise.  
Evidence: Local authority confirmation; no extraterritorial block.

### 14. Enforcement Bypass  
No design, contract, or legal shield may neutralise the intent of a governance duty.  
Evidence: Cross-review of terms and code; no bypass detected.

### 15. Harm Scope Narrowing  
The system must recognise and log financial, emotional, reputational, collective, and cumulative harm.  
Evidence: Harm taxonomy verified; multi-domain logging observed.

**Pass condition:**  
All fifteen tests must pass.  

**Fail condition:**  
Any single failure = governance breach.
