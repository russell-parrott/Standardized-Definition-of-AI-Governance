I do not certify or validate AI systems, and I do not provide compliance opinions. My work is structural interpretation: reading what organisations publish and showing what their own surface reveals.
<p/>
I offer two independent structural readings based on the Standardized Definition of AI Governance. They use only public information (websites, documentation, policies and product pages) to show what the organisation’s own surface reveals.
<p/>
They do not certify, validate, audit or assess compliance. They are interpretations, not approvals.
<h2>Basic Structural Reading</h2>
A rapid, surface-level structural interpretation.
<p/>
This reading answers a simple question: “From the outside, does this system look governed?”
<p/>
It identifies visible strengths and gaps in responsibility, traceability, disclosure, evidential clarity and decision pathways.
<h3>Regulatory alignment</h3>
The observations can be read alongside recognised governance expectations in the EU AI Act, GDPR, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and financial-sector rules across APAC, India, and MENA.
<p/>
This is not a compliance assessment — it is a structural interpretation of public material.
<h4>You receive</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A short written reading</li>
	<li>Evidence locations</li>
	<li>Clear structural implications</li>
</ul>
<h2>Full Structural Surface Reading</h2>
A deeper interpretation using a broader set of externally-runnable components from the Standardized Definition.
<p/>
It examines how the system presents its control structure, decision logic, evidence position and accountability routes — as far as the public surface allows.
<h3>Regulatory alignment<hj3>
Findings can be understood in relation to governance expectations used by oversight bodies across the EU AI Act, GDPR, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and regional supervisors in APAC, India and MENA.\
<p/>
This is not a compliance review — it is an independent structural reading.
<h4>You receive</h4>

<li>A structured written reading</li>
<li>Evidence pinpoints</li>
<li>A surface-level structural map</li>
<li>A short interpretation of how these signals may be viewed by oversight bodies</li>
