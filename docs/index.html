				<h1>Structural Governance</h1>
				This site hosts a public reference framework for evaluating whether AI governance claims can be proven under enforcement conditions.
				<p/>
				Every major institution claims to have AI governance. They publish frameworks, appoint officers, conduct audits and issue compliance reports. Then their systems fail anyway.
				<p/>
				<strong>Why?</strong>
				<p/>
				Because traditional governance documents describe what organisations intend to do, not what their systems structurally permit. When harm occurs, you cannot prove it with a policy document. 
				<p/>
				You will need evidence. You will need traceability and you need the accountability that survives contact with lawyers, vendors and jurisdictional boundaries.
				<p/>
				Using The Standardized Definition of AI Governance this framework measures and maps what systems actually permit, not what policies claim to require.

				<h2>Structural Evidence</h2>
				Structural evidence comes from structural measurement, which evaluates governance by testing whether the underlying infrastructure can actually enforce the rules it claims to follow. It doesn’t assess intentions or policies; it checks whether the system has the logs, traceability, controls and evidence pathways needed to make those policies real, inspectable and enforceable in practice.<p/>
				Structural measurement determines whether AI systems have the infrastructure needed to enforce the rules they claim to follow.

				<h4>Why Organisations Use These Tests</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal Defense</strong> <em>(Primary liability exposure)</em><br/>
						When you're sued for AI harm, policy documents won't save you. Reconstruction chains will. These tests prove you had structural controls, not just aspirational ones.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Incident Reconstruction</strong> <em> (Post-failure liability)</em><br/>
						After a failure, you need to prove what happened and who's responsible. These tests measure whether that reconstruction is even possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Board-Level Assurance</strong> <em>(Director/Officer liability)</em><br/>
						Directors need to know if governance is real or theater. These tests provide concrete, measurable evidence of structural capabilities.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regulatory Preparation</strong> <em>(Compliance liability)</em><br/>
						Regulators increasingly demand evidence, not attestations. These tests provide the audit trails and accountability maps that prove compliance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Vendor Due Diligence</strong> <em>(Third-party liability)</em><br/>
						Before you integrate a third-party AI system, you need to know if their claims are structurally true. These tests verify capabilities independently.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Strategic Investment</strong> <em>(Operational risk)</em><br/>
						Before spending millions on governance infrastructure, know which gaps actually matter. These tests identify the critical structural failures that require immediate attention.

				<h5>About Russell Parrott</h5>
				Most AI governance is performative. Organisations publish frameworks, appoint officers and issue assurances that appear robust but fail when systems are challenged. The gap is not rhetorical. It is structural.
				<p/>
				My work focuses on structural interpretation. I examine what organisations publish and analyse what their systems’ public surface actually reveals about control, accountability and failure under pressure.
				<p/>
				The Standardized Definition of AI Governance is a reference framework comprising 25 binary tests and 7 continuous metrics. It distinguishes governance that exists in practice from governance that is merely performed. The framework operates on four minimum conditions for control:
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Refusal</strong> - preventing actions that breach defined boundaries.</li>
				<li><strong>Escalation</strong> - ensuring failure reaches an accountable authority with power to act.</li>
				<li><strong>Exit</strong> - allowing withdrawal when coercion, capture or dependency emerges.</li>
				<li><strong>Traceability</strong> - linking every decision to an accountable source.</li>
				</ul>
				<p/>
				These are not principles or aspirations. They are tests. They convert ethics into evidence and accountability into something verifiable under inspection. They are not audits, certifications or compliance assessments.
				<p/>
				I do not certify systems or provide compliance opinions. I show what holds and what breaks when governance claims are subjected to structural pressure.

<li><strong>Below 40: The Hidden Fragility of AI Systems</strong>
<p/>
AI systems are powerful, fast and increasingly embedded in critical decisions but most cannot prove how they work. The Evidential Resilience Ratio (ERR) offers a structural lens for understanding this gap. It doesn’t tell engineers how to build systems; it reveals what those systems already are: how traceable, reconstructable, version-consistent and dependency-bound they remain beneath the surface.
<p/>
The future of AI won’t belong to the most capable systems, but to the ones that can prove themselves.
