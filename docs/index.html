I do not certify or validate AI systems, and I do not provide compliance opinions. My work is structural interpretation: reading what organisations publish and showing what their own surface reveals.

The standards I maintain are open and fixed. Their interpretation is independent — and that is where my work begins.

I work in structural enforcement: the architecture of governance that reveals what holds and what breaks when systems are placed under pressure.

The Standardized Definition of AI Governance is the first enforceable system able to distinguish governance in practice from governance in performance. It defines four minimum conditions for control:

Refusal — preventing actions that breach boundaries.
Escalation — ensuring failure reaches accountable authority.
Exit — withdrawing when coercion or capture emerges.
Traceability — linking every decision to its accountable source.

These are not principles or aspirations. They are tests of enforceability that convert ethics into evidence and accountability into something verifiable.

From this foundation I perform two forms of external structural analysis, both based solely on public information and requiring disciplined interpretation:

Basic Structural Reading — a short, surface-level structural interpretation.
Full Structural Surface Reading — a deeper analysis using the externally-runnable components of the Definition.

These are not audits, validations or compliance assessments. They are structured interpretations of what an organisation’s public surface implies under independent inspection.

The Standardized Definition operates under a dual-track licence:
Public Use (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) — free to share and cite without modification.
Institutional / Commercial Use — licensed for use in compliance frameworks, governance policies, training, client deliverables or regulatory submissions.

Enforcement without independence is theatre. Independence with structure is governance — and that is where accountability begins to count.
