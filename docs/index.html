				<h1>AI Governance: Structural Evidence</h1>
				Every major institution claims to have AI governance. They publish frameworks, appoint officers, conduct audits and issue compliance reports. Then their systems fail anyway.
				<p/>
				<strong>Why?</strong>
				<p/>
				Because traditional governance documents describe what organisations intend to do, not what their systems structurally permit. When harm occurs, you cannot prove it with a policy document. 
				<p/>
				You will need evidence. You will need traceability and you need the accountability that survives contact with lawyers, vendors and jurisdictional boundaries.
				<p/>
				Using The Standardized Definition of AI Governance together with public evidence; website, policies, documentation and marketing materials, I measure and map what systems actually permit, not what policies claim to require.

				<h2>Structural Evidence</h2>
				Structural evidence comes from structural measurement, which evaluates governance by testing whether the underlying infrastructure can actually enforce the rules it claims to follow. It doesn’t assess intentions or policies; it checks whether the system has the logs, traceability, controls and evidence pathways needed to make those policies real, inspectable and enforceable in practice.<p/>
				I carry out structural measurement by determining whether your AI systems have the infrastructure needed to enforce the rules they claim to follow. I verify the presence of traceability, accountability, evidence retention and cross-boundary controls, not on paper, but in the behaviour your system exposes from the outside.

				<h4>Why Organisations Use These Tests</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal Defense</strong> <em>(Primary liability exposure)</em><br/>
						When you're sued for AI harm, policy documents won't save you. Reconstruction chains will. These tests prove you had structural controls, not just aspirational ones.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Incident Reconstruction</strong> <em> (Post-failure liability)</em><br/>
						After a failure, you need to prove what happened and who's responsible. These tests measure whether that reconstruction is even possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Board-Level Assurance</strong> <em>(Director/Officer liability)</em><br/>
						Directors need to know if governance is real or theater. These tests provide concrete, measurable evidence of structural capabilities.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regulatory Preparation</strong> <em>(Compliance liability)</em><br/>
						Regulators increasingly demand evidence, not attestations. These tests provide the audit trails and accountability maps that prove compliance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Vendor Due Diligence</strong> <em>(Third-party liability)</em><br/>
						Before you integrate a third-party AI system, you need to know if their claims are structurally true. These tests verify capabilities independently.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Strategic Investment</strong> <em>(Operational risk)</em><br/>
						Before spending millions on governance infrastructure, know which gaps actually matter. These tests identify the critical structural failures that require immediate attention.

				<h5>About Russell Parrott</h5>
				Most AI governance is theater. Companies publish frameworks that look impressive but collapse under pressure. I expose the gap between what organisations claim and what their systems can actually enforce.
				<p/>
				My work is structural interpretation: I read what companies publish and show what their own surface reveals about control, accountability and failure points.
				<p/>
				The Standardized Definition of AI Governance - a framework with 25 binary tests and 7 continuous metrics distinguishes governance in practice from governance performance.  The framework operates on four minimum conditions for control:
				<ol>
				<li><strong>Refusal</strong>: preventing actions that breach boundaries.</li>
				<li><strong>Escalation</strong>: ensuring failure reaches accountable authority.</li>
				<li><strong>Exit</strong>: withdrawing when coercion or capture emerges.</li>
				<li><strong>Traceability</strong>: linking every decision to its accountable source.</li>
				</ol>
				These aren't principles. They're tests that convert ethics into evidence and accountability into something verifiable, not audits, validations or compliance assessments.
				<p/>
				They are structured interpretations of what an organisation's public surface implies under independent inspection.
				<p/>
				I do not certify systems. I do not provide compliance opinions. I show what holds and what breaks when governance claims meet structural pressure.
