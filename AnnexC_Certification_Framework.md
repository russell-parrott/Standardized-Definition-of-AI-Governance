# Annex C — Certification and Continuous Verification Framework

This annex defines the certification and verification architecture governing conformity with *The Standardized Definition of AI Governance (v1.0)*.  
It establishes how Structural Tests are administered, verified, and maintained across time and jurisdiction.

---

## 1. Purpose
Certification verifies that an AI system demonstrably meets all fifteen Structural Tests under live or adversarial conditions.  
It is not a declaration of intent or policy alignment; it is a binary verification of control.

---

## 2. Certification Entities
**Certification Body**  
An independent, multi-stakeholder organisation with legal identity, transparent funding, and published conflict-of-interest rules.

**Certified Practitioner**  
An accredited individual or team authorised to perform Structural Tests, issue reports, and sign verification records. Practitioners operate under public registry, periodic revalidation, and rotation requirements.

**Accrediting Authority**  
A public or intergovernmental body empowered to recognise Certification Bodies and monitor their impartiality.

---

## 3. Certification Process
1. **Application** — The system operator submits documentation identifying scope, version, jurisdiction, and operational environment.  
2. **Preparation** — The Certification Body validates test scope, ensures independence, and assigns Certified Practitioners.  
3. **Testing** — All fifteen Structural Tests are conducted under live or adversarial conditions without prior staging or modification.  
4. **Verification** — Evidence bundles are generated, hashed, and logged in a verifiable audit ledger.  
5. **Decision** — Certification is granted only if all tests pass without exception.  
6. **Publication** — A public summary is added to the Certification Register with verification date, scope, and expiry.

---

## 4. Continuous Verification
Certification remains valid only while verification integrity persists.  
Each certified system is subject to:
- **Unannounced audits** at any time by independent practitioners.  
- **Continuous monitoring** of Structural Test indicators.  
- **Public verification records** accessible to regulators and affected parties.  
- **Automatic suspension** if logs or interfaces become inaccessible.

---

## 5. Certification Integrity Safeguards
- Rotation of practitioners and audit teams.  
- Mandatory disclosure of funding and client relationships.  
- Multi-jurisdictional peer oversight.  
- Tamper-evident recordkeeping using cryptographic signatures and distributed logs.  
- Annual publication of all revoked, suspended, or expired certifications.

---

## 6. Revocation
Certification is automatically revoked when:
- Any Structural Test fails during live re-verification.  
- The Certification Body or Practitioner breaches independence requirements.  
- Access to evidence records or control interfaces is obstructed.  
- A jurisdiction of harm issues a binding notice of non-conformance.

Revocation is immediate, public, and non-discretionary.

---

## 7. Recognition and Alignment
Certification under this framework may be recognised by public authorities, regulators, or standards bodies provided:
- The process and results remain public;  
- No clauses modify or weaken the Structural Tests;  
- Recognition does not exempt any party from jurisdictional accountability.

---

## 8. Records and Registry
All issued certificates must include:
- System name and operator  
- Date and jurisdiction of certification  
- List of Certified Practitioners  
- Cryptographic hash of verification record  
- Public registry link

Registers are maintained by Certification Bodies and mirrored by Accrediting Authorities for continuity.

---

## 9. Expiry and Renewal
Certification expires automatically after one year or upon material system modification, whichever occurs first. Renewal requires complete re-testing.

---

## 10. Legal Standing
Certification demonstrates structural governance conformity; it does not substitute for regulatory approval.  
A certified system remains subject to applicable law and enforcement within every jurisdiction of harm.
