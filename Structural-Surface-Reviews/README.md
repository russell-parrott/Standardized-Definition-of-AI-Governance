# Independent Structural Readings

I provide two independent readings grounded in the Standardized Definition. Each examines only what the organisation has already placed on the public surface. These readings do not certify, validate, audit or endorse. They interpret what can be directly inferred about authority, traceability and accountability from outward-facing design alone.
				
Regulators and oversight bodies use the same logic: surface architecture reveals governance long before access is granted.

The Standardized Definition is open under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
The readings are independent commercial interpretations, separate from the doctrine.
