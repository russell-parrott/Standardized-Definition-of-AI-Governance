# Basic Structural Reading

The Basic Structural Reading answers a single foundational question: from the outside, does this system appear governed?

It works from the organisation’s own disclosures. The reading interprets how responsibility is allocated, how decision pathways are presented, how evidence and records are described and how clearly governance roles are expressed. No speculation is added. Only what the organisation has chosen to expose is used.

Although it is not a compliance assessment, the observations can be read alongside governance expectations in the EU AI Act, GDPR, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001 and financial-sector rules across APAC, India and MENA. The focus is not on pass or fail but on whether the surface is consistent with the kind of structure regulators expect to see when they look for control and accountability.

You receive a concise written reading with specific evidence locations and direct structural implications. It is designed to provide a fast, external view of whether the organisation’s surface signals coherent governance or early indicators of exposure, weakness or internal inconsistency.
