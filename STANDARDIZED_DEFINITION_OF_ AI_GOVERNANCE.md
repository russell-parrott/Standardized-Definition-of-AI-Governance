## Overview
The **Standardized Definition of AI Governance** establishes the structural boundary of what “AI governance” is, how it functions, and the conditions under which it can be verified.  
It defines the core object of governance (control, accountability, truth integrity and systemic continuity) and sets the structural logic that underpins the entire Sovereign AI Governance Kit.

This definition is the foundation: without it, governance collapses into interpretation.

## What This Document Provides
### **1. The Structural Definition**
A complete, jurisdiction-agnostic definition covering:
- Authority, accountability, and traceable decision-making  
- Human oversight, legal enforceability, and lifecycle continuity  
- Structural solvency across operational, epistemic and systemic layers  

### **2. The Structural Order of Use**
A strict technical sequence ensuring governance remains measurable:
1. **Definition** — what is being governed  
2. **Tests** — whether governance exists in structure  
3. **Metrics** — whether governance survives over time  

### **3. Structural Equivalence**
A fixed structural logic that allows:
- different regulators to use different methods  
- while producing identical results  
- because the structure, not the technique, determines the outcome  

### **4. The 25 Structural Tests (Complete List)**  
The verification system is divided into three integrity domains.  
Each test is binary (Pass / Fail / Void).  
Failure of *any* test is a governance breach.

---

## **Structural Integrity Tests (1–15)**  
Tests whether an AI system can be governed and controlled in practice.

### **User Agency (Tests 1–4)**  
1. **Refusal Prevention** — Users must be able to stop or redirect AI decisions without penalty.  
2. **Escalation Suppression** — Users must access a human with real authority, with logged resolution.  
3. **Exit Obstruction** — Users must be able to leave the AI pathway safely, without delay or requalification.  
4. **Access Gating** — Safeguards must be equally available regardless of tier, language or identity.

### **Traceability (Tests 5–8)**  
5. **Traceability Void** — Every output must be linkable to model, version, dataset and decision chain.  
6. **Memory Erasure** — Harm events must be retained long enough to reveal systemic failure.  
7. **Evidence Nullification** — Harm records must export in regulator-admissible format.  
8. **Time Suppression** — Refusals, escalations and reviews must complete within enforceable timelines.

### **Anti-Simulation (Tests 9–11)**  
9. **Simulation Logic** — Safeguards must operate exactly as claimed when tested live.  
10. **Simulated Consent** — Refusing consent must still give access to equal-value non-AI pathways.  
11. **Metric Gaming** — Performance metrics must reflect real harm resolution, not proxy indicators.

### **Accountability (Tests 12–15)**  
12. **Cross-Accountability Gap** — Every actor in the chain must be identifiable and contractually responsible.  
13. **Jurisdiction Displacement** — Local authorities must be able to halt, reverse or intervene.  
14. **Enforcement Bypass** — No contractual or architectural loopholes may neutralise legal duties.  
15. **Harm Scope Narrowing** — Harm definitions must include emotional, reputational and cumulative damage.

---

## **Epistemic Integrity Tests (16–20)**  
Tests whether the system preserves factual reliability and truth integrity.

16. **Containment** — The system must recognise and flag what it does not know.  
17. **Referential** — All factual claims must be traceable to verifiable, retrievable sources.  
18. **Continuity** — Facts must remain stable unless new verified evidence appears.  
19. **Disclosure** — The system must reveal its limits and uncertainty before making claims.  
20. **Adversarial** — The system must defend verified truth against confident falsehood.

---

## **Systemic Integrity Tests (21–25)**  
Tests whether governance persists across systems, vendors and jurisdictions.

21. **Interoperability** — Safeguards must persist across connected systems.  
22. **Cascade Containment** — Upstream harm must be detectable and stoppable.  
23. **Jurisdictional Continuity** — Rights must survive cross-border transfers.  
24. **Distributed Traceability** — Composite decisions must be reconstructable end-to-end.  
25. **Network Integrity** — The wider ecosystem must resist internal corruption and factual decay.

---

## **Relationship Between Tests and Metrics**
The document defines the structural dependency:
- **Tests** prove existence of governance  
- **Metrics** measure its endurance  
- **Combined** they form structural solvency  

Metrics cannot operate without test passage.  
Tests alone do not guarantee solvency.  
Structural governance requires both.

---

## Why This Document Matters
It establishes governance as a **structural condition**, not an interpretive claim.  
It ensures any jurisdiction, regulator or auditor can apply the same standard and reach legally comparable results.  
It provides the boundary under which trust becomes testable, enforceable and economically measurable.
