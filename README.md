## Overview

This repository contains two formally linked reference standards:

1. **The Standardized Definition of AI Governance (Version 1.0.4)**  
   *The structural definition, the 25-test verification framework, and the three-domain integrity model.*

2. **The AI Governance Measurement Framework (Version 1.0.1)**  
   *The seven-metric solvency system, the loss channels (NTAD, PRE, VAG), and the macro-economic formulation of Annual Governance Loss (AGL).*

Together they form a single doctrine:  
**Definition → Tests → Metrics → Economic Quantification.**  
Structure first, measurement second.

Both documents are immutable, open, and non-derivable under **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**.

## Purpose of the Repository

This repository provides a **canonical**, cross-jurisdictional reference for:

- Regulators needing a neutral, testable governance definition.  
- Researchers evaluating structural, epistemic, or systemic integrity.  
- Auditors and oversight bodies requiring reproducible governance tests.  
- Public institutions translating governance failure into measurable economic loss.

The materials define governance as a **structural condition**, not a policy preference or software outcome.  
They convert “trust”, “accountability” and “oversight” into **verifiable architecture** and **quantifiable macro-variables**.

## Contents

### **1. Standardized Definition of AI Governance (1.0.4)**

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17505286.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17505286)

Includes:

- Formal definition and purpose of AI Governance  
- Structural, Epistemic, and Systemic integrity domains  
- **25-Test Verification Framework**  
-- Structural order of use  
-- Structural equivalence rules  
- Origin and authorship  

This document establishes **what governance is**, **what must hold true**, and **how failure is detected**.

### **2. AI Governance Measurement Framework (1.0.1)**

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17552324.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17552324)

Includes:

- Seven solvency metrics (CER, PSI, PER, LCR, TSI, CRS, MGI)  
- The three macro-economic loss channels (NTAD, PRE, VAG)  
- AGL, GLR, and GRV formulas  
- Adoption and custody scaling  
- Worked examples across sectors and national economies  

This document establishes **how governance becomes a measurable economic variable**.

## Structural Logic

The two standards operate as a single system with strict sequencing:

1. **Definition** — establishes the structural conditions for governance.  
2. **Tests (25)** — binary, adversarial verification of those conditions.  
3. **Metrics (7)** — continuous solvency measurement within the same domains.  
4. **Economic Formulation** — quantifies trust failure as economic loss.

- Good metrics without passed tests = unverified assumption.  
- Passed tests without metrics = governance decay.

## Intended Use

The purpose of this repository is to anchor a single, global, immutable structure for AI governance.  
It ensures that:

- A regulator in Nairobi  
- An auditor in Brussels  
- A researcher in Singapore  
- A public institution in Toronto  

…can apply identical structural logic and reach legally comparable results.

The doctrine remains **above corporate tooling**, **outside vendor capture**, and **beyond national asymmetry**.
