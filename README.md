## Purpose
This repository hosts the authoritative text of **The Standardized Definition of AI Governance**, the first framework that defines AI governance as a measurable structural condition.
It sets out how integrity, accountability and control can be proven inside any system, government or AI platform.

The framework replaces policy language with structure. It tests whether power can be refused, traced and held to account. It measures not what organisations claim to believe, but what their architecture actually allows them to do.

## What It Does

The definition works through a three-part sequence:

- Definition → Structural Tests → Metrics
- Definition – establishes what “governance” means as a verifiable condition.
- Structural Tests – fifteen checks that show whether accountability, traceability and refusal exist under pressure.
- Metrics – seven measures that quantify how stable those conditions remain once proven to exist.

The order only matters when the tests and metrics are used together. Partial use of the tests is valid for analysis but does not produce solvency or measurable governance.
